# Jump-Game
This Android Studio game is an infinite loop based on the game Flappy Bird. The game is played by tapping on the screen to make Flappy jump and catch the coins. 

There are two classes that displayed on the screen: the Coin class and the Flappy class. In the Coin class, I coded the movement of the coins across the screen, The Flappy class consists of moving up and down but not left to right. However, with the coins moving acrross the screen horizontally, we get an illusion of Flappy moving. 

I generated the placement of the coins in the GameView class by randomly generating two case scenarios: 1) In which we hardcode the position of the coin and 2) where I generate the x position ramdomly. When the Flappy sprite and the coin collide, the coin is "caught" and removed from the screen.
